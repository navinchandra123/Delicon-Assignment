# Login, Registration with Authentication and CRUD Operations using HTML | CSS | BOOTSTRAP | NODEJS | MONGODB | EJS

I have created a web application that contains the Login page, a Registration page, and a reservation page. Application is fully authenticated.
In Registration page we take the detail of restaurant owners and set it into our database (Mongodb) 
In Login page we ask for email and password of user and if email and password both are correct then we redirect the user to 
the dashboard.

Dashboard has the menu of the restaurant owner can edit or delete the food's data. And if owner wants to enter new food data then we take the food data
information and store it into our batabas which is mongodb. And if User wants to logout from dashbord then he click on Logout button and he got logout.

For the better understanding, I am uploading some screenshots:-

- ### When we open our site, first view is:

- ### When we click on Register ,  we will be redirected to Registration page which is looks like

If we do not fill any fields or Enter unmatched password then it gives us a flash message
